# Popcorn party
# Inspiration
COVID-19 has shut down many movie theaters and eliminated the real-life social aspect from watching movies. We wanted to give people not just an avenue to connect with others as they watch movies, but to ACTIVELY connect, because even before COVID-19, watching movies can be such a passive experience. Here is our [devpost submission](https://devpost.com/software/popcorn-party)!

# What it does
It allows you to share your opinions with people in real-time as you watch movies. You can find favorite commentators and plan to join the movie events that they attend. If you’re feeling impatient, you can find an event that starts within the hour. If you want to host your own movie, you can invite family and friends to watch with you. Never sit in silence as you appreciate movies again!

# How we built it
This program was built with a mix of HTML, CSS and Python. HTML and CSS were in use for the front end and Django was being used in the back end. Using GitHub we were able to work collaboratively over the course of the day to maximize production. 

# Challenges we ran into
The time constraint was a big challenge that we had to deal with. Because of it we were forced to prioritize certain elements to ensure that there was some sort of product at the end of the hackathon. A lack of experience in some of the coding languages we used also proved to be a challenge. Most of us were not familiar with the structure of a web-app and had to learn how frontend and backend elements make up a full-stack app. 

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
For three of us it’s our first hackathon and for one of us it’s our second. We’re really proud of being able to learn so much in only 24 hours. 

# What we learned 
Two of us learned to use GitHub and Git for the first time, one of us used Django for the first time, one of us coded in HTML and CSS for the first time, and one of us took the role of leading and teaching the team the entire web app design process even though this was their second hackathon ever. 

# What's next for Popcorn Party
We’d love to fully connect the front and backend of the web app to produce a seamless movie and social experience. To present our users with accurate and current information about each movie, we’d also need to connect to a movie API.
